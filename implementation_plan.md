#What does this repo do in plain language?

This project analyzes bank loan data using SQL to understand which customers are most likely to default and why.
It helps a bank figure out which borrowers are risky and how to improve loan approval decisions using data.

#What would you need to change to use it for a real company?

Replace the sample dataset with real operational data
Add security, privacy, and access controls e.g 
Automate the pipeline instead of running SQL manually
Expand the analytics: A real company would require;

  Predictive modeling (logistic regression, XGBoost)
  
  Probability of default (PD) scoring
  
  Early warning indicators
